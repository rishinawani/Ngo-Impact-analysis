# Ngo-Impact-analysis
The goal of the project is to gain insights into the effectiveness of assignments (projects) and the contributions from donors to maximize impact and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources.
## Overview
GoodThought NGO conducts various assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged communities. These assignments are data-rich and can be evaluated based on:
### Assignments: The name, region, duration, and the calculated impact score of each project.
### Donations: Financial records tied to specific assignments, allowing analysis of funding trends.
### Donors: The types and identities of donors, helping identify which types of donors contribute most to which projects or regions.
